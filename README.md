A collection of articles and awesome things to read on a lunch break. Never stop learning.

"First ‚Äì I‚Äôm very tired of posts that complain about how people are ‚Äúwrong‚Äù about how a given piece of technology works without explaining why it‚Äôs helpful to be ‚Äúright‚Äù." --Julia Evans, which is to say, love the tree for its roots, for its knots, for its hidden grain and rings.

Picked from things I have found useful or interesting at my discretion. Articles are loosely categorized but should not be considered to be defined by their category as they often overlap.
